title: Dynamic colour palettes with CSS color-mix()
---

The new CSS color-mix() function gives us something Iâ€™ve wanted for a long time - the ability to generate tints, shades and even an entire colour palette from a single given colour in plain CSS. With all the [cool new CSS features](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/whats-new-css-ui-2023/) dropping lately, this one flew under the radar a bit, but itâ€™s actually capable of a lot more than I first thought.


### What about relative colour syntax?                                                                                                                                                                              


The new CSS relative-color-syntax is going to give us even more flexibility for generating dynamic colours, but (as of writing) browser support is still lacking (only Safari 16.4+). There are a few polyfills, the best of which is probably [postcss-relative-color-syntax](https://github.com/csstools/postcss-plugins/tree/main/plugins/postcss-relative-color-syntax), but (being a preprocessor) PostCSS plugins canâ€™t fully support CSS custom properties within declarations, which severely limits what you can achieve. 


### color-mix() to the rescue


Color-mix() can do exactly what the name suggests, but with cylindrical colour spaces (LCH, OKLCH, HSL & HWB) we can do some pretty cool things, like generating complimentary and analogous colour palettes from a single colour, and it now [has support in all major browsers](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_color_color-mix) ðŸŽ‰


The CodePen below demonstrates some of what can be done - just change the â€”brandColour custom property to generate all sorts of relative colours!

## How it works


_**A quick note on colour spacesâ€¦**_


_The colour space you choose can drastically change the result of color-mix(). For these examples Iâ€™m going to stick to OKLAB and OKLCH, as they seem to produce the best results (and theyâ€™re also_ [now supported in all major browsers too!](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_types_color_oklch)_)_


### The syntax


For basic usage, we define the colour space that we want to output to, then the colours we want to mix.


```css
p{
color: color-mix(in oklab, red, blue); // Makes purple
}
```


This will make a new OKLAB colour by mixing 50% red and 50% blue.


We can also control the percentages by which the colours should be mixed


```css
p{
color: color-mix(in oklab, red, blue 25%); // Makes purpley-pink
}
```


This will mix 75% red and 25% blue. By specifying one percentage value, the other will be inferred to make up 100%.


### Generating tints and shades


To make tints and shades of a given colour, we can mix white or black of varying percentages. The results are a lot more predictable than Sass lighten() and darken().


```css
:root{
--brandColour: cornflowerblue;
--tint: color-mix(in oklab, var(--brandColour), #fff 75%);
--shade: color-mix(in oklab, var(--brandColour), #000 40%);
}

button{
color: var(--shade);
background-color: var(--tint);
}
```


### Hue interpolation


There is one more option we can define: the `hue` interpolation method. The possible values are `shorter`, `longer`, `increasing` and `decreasing`. This option is only valid for cylindrical colour spaces, and is a syntax error in the others.


```css
p{
color: color-mix(in oklch shorter hue, red, blue 50%);
}
```


This gives us a nice bright purple as you would expect.


```css
p{
color: color-mix(in oklch longer hue, red, blue 50%);
}
```


But this is where it gets fun. You might reasonably expect this to give you purple as well, but the output is green! Letâ€™s figure out whyâ€¦


### How hue interpolation works


All cylindrical colour spaces use a `hue` value specified in degrees (between 0 and 360). The hue interpolation method determines the path taken through the colour space when generating the new colour. 


The default value is `shorter`, which takes the shortest path between the two colours within the colour space.


If we use `longer`, color-mix() takes the longest path between the two colours.


![shorter-vs-longer-hue.jpg](https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/b6806286-6dab-4379-b71e-8d3c910cb81a/shorter-vs-longer-hue.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Content-Sha256=UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAT73L2G45EIPT3X45%2F20230706%2Fus-west-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20230706T120256Z&X-Amz-Expires=3600&X-Amz-Signature=428402679ace376720440ba6c2e0de62eebd28ae77c77af8f8c91c3c496a3f00&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&x-id=GetObject)


This is how we ended up with green in the previous example, and this gives us a lot of flexibility to effectively create relative colours, without the relative colour syntax.


`Increasing` will return and angle between 0 and 360deg, while `decreasing` will return and angle between 0 and -360deg. 


In the end, the hue angle wraps around and is normalised to be between 0 and 360deg, so -120deg is equivalent to 240deg.


### Complimentary colours


The trick here is that by mixing a colour with itself, and specifying the `longer` hue interpolation method,  color-mix() will go all the way around the colour space and stop on the opposite side of the colour wheel (or at whatever percentage we specify).


```css
p{
color: color-mix(in oklch longer hue, hotpink, hotpink);
}
```


### Analogous colours


We can specify percentage values to generate any relative colour we want. 


```css
:root{
--brand: hotpink;
}
li:nth-child(1){
background: color-mix(in oklch longer hue, var(--brand) 10%, var(--brand));
}
li:nth-child(2){
background: color-mix(in oklch longer hue, var(--brand) 20%, var(--brand));
}
li:nth-child(3){
background: color-mix(in oklch longer hue, var(--brand) 60%, var(--brand));
}
li:nth-child(3){
background: color-mix(in oklch longer hue, var(--brand) 70%, var(--brand));
}

```


Using this method, we can generate any relative colour palette we want - analogous, split-complementary, triad etc., including tints and shades of each!


### Limitations


The main drawback of this method is that we can't individually adjust values such as lightness, chroma and hue like relative-color-syntax will allow. As such, it works best with vibrant colours around 50% lightness. You also need to be careful with contrast when using user defined colours. 


### Firefox behaviour


Youâ€™ll notice in the codepen demo above that Iâ€™m generating an extra colour like this


```css
:root{
--brand: hotpink;
--brandClone: color-mix(in oklch, var(--brand), white 0.0001%); /* too many 0's breaks it :/ */
}
```


This is because, in Firefox 114, mixing a colour with itself always seems to result in the original colour being returned, regardless of the hue interpolation method. But by making a new colour thatâ€™s a teeny tiny bit lighter than the original, then mixing themâ€¦


```css
p{
color: color-mix(in oklch longer hue, var(--brand), var(--brandClone));
}
```


we get the desired outcome.


I also found that the following does not work in Firefox


```css
:root{
--brand: hotpink;
/* 
Using OKLAB instead of OKLCH 
*/
--brandClone: color-mix(in oklab, var(--brand), white 0.0001%);
}
/*
Trying to nest color-mix() function using a non-cylindrical colour space
*/
p{
color: color-mix(in oklch longer hue, var(--brand), var(--brandClone));
}
```


So if you're nesting color-mix() functions like this, you'll need to use a consistent colour space.
