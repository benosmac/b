title: Customising View Transitions on-the-fly in Astro

This week I ran into a challenge when working with the same-document View Transitions API on an Astro site. I needed a transitions where the old content slides out and the new content slides in, **but** I needed the direction of the sliding to change depending on the page being navigated away from. The starting CSS looks like this:


```css
/* index */
body {
    view-transition-name: body;
}
::view-transition-old(body) {
    animation: slideDownOut 0.5s ease;
}
::view-transition-new(body) {
    animation: slideDownIn 0.5s ease);
}

@keyframes slideDownOut {
  from {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(100vh);
  }
}
@keyframes slideDownIn {
  from {
    transform: translateY(-100vh);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```


This works - the old page slides down and the new pages slides in from the top.


But what if, sometimes, we wanted it to slide the other way? 


The animation property for a `view-transition-image-pair` is taken from the new document (which makes sense, because same-document view transitions are intended to be used on the _same document)._ This means that if we want to have a different transition between specific pages we need a way to set styles on `::view-transition-*` pseudo-elements in the new document before the view transition runs.


Astro gives us some handy lifecycle events, and with the [`astro:before-swap`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/view-transitions/#astrobefore-swap) event we can access the `event.newDocument` property and change the `animation` on our view transition pseudo-elements:


```typescript
  <body data-slideOut="up">
	  <p>Beam me up!</p>
  </body>
  <style>
  body {
	  view-transition-name: body;
	  animation: slideDownIn .5s ease;
  }
  </style>
  
  <script>
  document.addEventListener("astro:before-swap", (ev) => {
	  // get the direction for our animation from the current page
    const direction = document.body.dataset.slideOut;
    
		// make an empty style tag
    const style = document.createElement("style");
		// conditionally set the contents
    if (direction == "up") {
      style.innerHTML = 
			      `::view-transition-old(body) {
              animation: slideUpOut 0.5s ease;
            }
            ::view-transition-new(body) {
              animation: slideUpIn 0.5s ease;
            }`;
    }
		// stick it in the head of ev.newDocument
    ev.newDocument.head.appendChild(style);
  });
  </script>
```


Here we define a data attribute on the `body` element that holds the direction for our ‘out’ animation. When the `astro:before-swap` event fires we read the `data-slideOut` attribute of the current document and insert the appropriate CSS into the head of the new document.


And that’s pretty much it. Now when we navigate away from any page with `data-slideOut=”up"` the new document will use the animation we specified.
