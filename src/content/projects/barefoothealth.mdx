Barefoot Health began as a personal training business with a unique twist; all sessions were conducted outdoors, on the grass, in bare feet. I designed their branding to capture Steve's ethos and passion for his work. That was over 10 years ago, and Steve has since built a thriving business by helping his clients through fitness, nutrition and lifestyle coaching.
