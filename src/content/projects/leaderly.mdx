Leaderly is a specialist leadership development and recruitment agency. They combine decades of experience across leadership coaching and consulting with modern testing and assessment techniques. I designed their branding to communicate their modern approach, differentiating them from the highly corporate cliches of executive recruitment. The elephant pictogram links to effective and progressive leadership traits; elephants are strong, empathetic and collaborative. The leader of an elephant herd is always the matriach, who cares for and watches over the entire herd.
