I designed the branding and illustrations for Oktoberfest Geelong, taking inspiration from the iconic bollard statues by Jan Mitchell, which can be found throughout the City of Greater Geelong, and traditional lederhosen and dirndl. I used a playful illustrative style and a beachy colour pallete combined with Old Style typography to bring Oktoberfest to the seaside.

Unfortunately the event was cancelled, but I decided to build the website anyway as a personal project. The site is built with Astro & React, with GSAP & view transitions for animations.
