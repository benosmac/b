I designed the branding and illustrations for Oktoberfest Geelong, taking inspiration from the iconic bollard statues by Jan Mitchell, which can be found throughout the City of Greater Geelong, and traditional lederhosen and dirndl. I used a playful illustrative style and a beachy colour pallete combined with Old Style typography to bring Oktoberfest to the seaside. I also designed and developed a marketing website for the event.
